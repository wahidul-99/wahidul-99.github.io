# What is the Critical Web Design Toolkit? 

The Critical Web Design Toolkit Project focuses on building a static website for the community to use for various digital scholarship projects. The project also aims to provide user-friendly, informative documentation about the steps that need to be followed in order to be able to use the static site builder efficiently. The underlying reasons behind constructing a static website builder starts from stressing on the environmental consequences that occur due to energy consumption by websites to handling issues surrounding accessibility, digital divide and other social and moral implications of web development tools. Hopefully this toolkit inspires you to not only build your best project, but also encourages you to continue your learning journey in web design and development.

## Who is it for? 

Everyone! Our toolkit is designed in such a way that people with no prior knowledge will be able to use our template or take inspiration from our template and create their own static website. If you are a student who needs a template to display your humanities project(s) or research work, you are in the right place! 

## Why use a Static Site? 

I know you might be tempted to close all of your tabs and pay for wordpress or square space at this point, but I promise that if you stick with this resource, you’ll get a lot out of learning how to build your own site with Jekyll, not to mention, it is free.  

Website performance is a crucial factor when it comes to running websites. In this aspect, static sites are very fast by nature as they serve the same HTML without any dynamic rendering. Static sites are also relatively safer when it comes to security breaches as there is no database to breach and no server-side platform with unpatched vulnerabilities. Moreover, hosting static sites are very inexpensive and even free depending on an individual’s preferences. Static sites are also very flexible to work with as there is no limitation about building a site. On top of that, it is very easy to keep track of using version control systems like Git and Github. 

## Who are the creators?  

The CWD Toolkit was designed and developed by the Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows at Bryn Mawr College, Arlowe Willingham, Rafiun Haque, Cameron Boucher, and Adrianna Morsey with oversight from Alice McGrath, Karina Gonzalez, Chris Boyland, and Stella Fritzell.

The project was developed by students who often use digital scholarship in their studies and understand the importance of web accessibility and resources for digital scholarship.  

### Our template is based on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme on Jekyll. This template is also inspired by [The Reactor Room.](https://ds-pages.swarthmore.edu/reactor-room/)
